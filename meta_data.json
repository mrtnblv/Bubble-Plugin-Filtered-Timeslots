    "description": "This plugin generates a list of timestamps based on a starting date, a time interval, specified time ranges, and optional excluded ranges. The timestamps are filtered to ensure they fall within the provided time ranges (24-hour format) while avoiding any excluded ranges.\n\nPerfect for scheduling, time slot creation, or custom date generation with advanced constraints.\n\nResult: The output is a list of dates that match the specified criteria.",
